# My Express Server

This project provides a simple Express.js server that serves static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Here's how the server is set up and instructions for modifying and customizing it. Before running the server, make sure to install the required packages by running `npm install`.

## Directory Structure

- `public/`: Contains all the public static files like CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.
  - `css/`: Place your CSS files here.
  - `js/`: Place your JavaScript files here.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates that are served by the server.
- `routes/`: Contains routing logic for the server.
- `app.js`: The main entry point for the server.
- `.env`: Contains environment variables for the server.

## How to Customize

### Modifying HTML

HTML files are located in the `templates/` directory. You can edit these files to update the HTML content served by the server.

### Adding CSS and JavaScript

Place your CSS files in the `public/css/` directory and JavaScript files in the `public/js/` directory. Reference them in your HTML files without the `/public/` prefix. For example:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.css">
<script src="js/app.js"></script>
```

### Updating Routes

Routes are defined in the `routes/` directory. You can modify or add new route files to customize how the server handles requests.

### Starting the Server

To start the server, run:

```bash
npm run serve
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:3000` or the port specified in the `.env` file.
As an example, the server contains a .env file specifying the port number: `PORT=8080`.

### Environment Configuration

Environment variables can be set in a `.env` file located in the root directory. This file might include settings like the port number. Make sure to install the required `dotenv` package and set up the `.env` file as needed.
